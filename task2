# Task2 - AIM

#1. Take application name and log file path
#2. The iteration should stop until the user exit without entering anything on the output screen
#3. Print application name and log path separetly
#4. Check weather the given path is empty or not
#5. Sepearate root name and file name for the given log path
#    For example :  log path is = /var/log/messages     :::: Here File name is messages   and    Root name is var
